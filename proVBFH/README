======================================================================

proVBFH (projection-to-Born Vector Boson-Fusion Higgs production) is a
computer program written to calculate QCD corrections to VBFH in the
structure function approach.

This package contains the full computer code, with the possibility to
compute fully inclusive cross sections up to next-to-next-to-next-to
leading order (N3LO) in QCD, as well as to evaluate fully differential
distributions up to NNLO.

For users mainly interested in inclusive cross sections, it is
recommended to use instead the separate code proVBFH-inclusive
(http://provbfh.hepforge.org) which provides a lighter interface.

Installation
---

To compile proVBFH, you will need
* hoppet (https://github.com/hoppet-code/hoppet)
* LHAPDF (http://lhapdf.hepforge.org/)
* FastJet (http://fastjet.fr/)

Once all dependencies are installed on your machine, proVBFH can be
compiled using:

  ./configure [--with-lhapdf=/path/to/lhapdf-config]
  	      [--with-hoppet=/path/to/hoppet-config]
	      [--with-fastjet=/path/to/fastjet-config]
  make

in the main directory. This will create an executable "proVBFH".

To compile proVBFH with a local installation of hoppet, fastjet or
LHAPDF, change the "DIR" above in the configure step to the folder
containing the hoppet-config, fastjet-config and lhapdf-config
executables respectively.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
---

To run proVBFH, use the proVBFH executable from a subfolder containing
a powheg.input and vbfnlo.input file.

An example is given in the example/ directory, which can be run using

  ../proVBFH

from the subfolder. To combine several runs, a combine_runs program is
provided in the aux/ folder. A list of options and more information on
setting up runs is given in the documentation for this program, in
docs/.
