Small study of various scale choices in vbf HH that approximate
sqrt(Q1Q2) reasonably well. THis was prompted by a referee comment for
2511.02488.

The plots show, that the scale choice that we make, and that we made
in the original VBF HH papers with Frederic, is a good one, as in the
range ptHH 0-150 GeV (where most of the cross section lives) it is
very close to the "optimal" sqrt(Q1Q2).

This is also what we had found in VBF single Higgs production, but we
never produced the corresponding plots for di-Higgs (we did for single
Higgs on a private branch).

To reproduce the datafiles compile proVBFHH with the
`scale_analysis.f` analysis and run it here.
