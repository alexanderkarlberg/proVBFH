#+TITLE: Separation checks
#+STARTUP: logdone entitiespretty latexpreview

This folder contains plots checking the correctness of the separation
in upper and lower sides.

We plot sigma_wrong / sigma_total, where sigma_wrong is the cross
section for wrongly assigned partons.

*Summary*
    1) all jets have |y| > DY
    2) jets at +ve rap (-ve) come exclusively from particles 
       at +ve (-ve) end

    Work out (!2)/(1) as a function of DY
    
    : 
    :  j1      |          |  j2
    :    j3    |          |    
    : 
    :        Y=-DY       Y=DY     ----> Y
                    

If the internal tagging is correct, then the ratio should drop off
rapidly as Y_cut increases.

The plots contained in this folder are the following:

 - checks-[0-6].ps       : NLO checks, integrated in Ycut
 - checks-[0-6]-deriv.ps : NLO checks, differential in Ycut
 - checks-[0-6]-LO.ps    : LO checks, differential in Ycut

The plots are obtained using the corresponding top files, from the
gnuplot scripts in the folder.
