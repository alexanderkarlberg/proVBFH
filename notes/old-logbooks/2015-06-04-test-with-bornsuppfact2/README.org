We want to see if running with bornsuppfact = 2 instead of 1 makes a difference
in terms of outliers, as Giulia suspects.

For this, we compare about 100 independent runs for the NLO exclusive
contribution,performed with ncall1=2e5, itmx1=3, ncall2=1e6, itmx2=5

We find, for the VBF 2 jets cuts case:

old setup, bornsupp=1

-0.096 +- 0.007      20% exclusion
-0.098 +- 0.007      10% exclusion
-0.106 +- 0.015       2% exclusion
-0.091 +- 0.018       no exclusion

new setup, bornsupp=2

-0.096 +- 0.007      20% exclusion
-0.097 +- 0.008      10% exclusion
-0.097 +- 0.009       2% exclusion
-0.093 +- 0.009       no exclusion

While nothing changes when excluding as much as 20%, both the central value
and the error are otherwise much more stable with bornsupp=2 when excluding
less. Upon examining visually the individual results, there are no more huge
fluctuations as in the previous case.

A visual examination can be done looking at the plots excl-nlo.ps (with
bornsupp=1) and excl-nlo-bornsupp2.ps (with bornsupp=2, obviously)
(NB the full result and error in the  excl-nlo.ps (with bornsupp=1) plot are
made with about 200 runs rather than 100 like in the bornsupp=2 case. Hence the
overall smaller error.

One should however look at the fluctuations of the individual results in the two
top plots: the huge fluctuations (top-left plot) have disappeared in the
bornsupp=2 case
