This folder contains files for testing the apparent discrepancy which
exists when using NNPDF between HOPPET and POWHEG.

All files are at LO with parameters as in our paper. Plots are done at
14 TeV with Narrowwidth.

Ratios contains HOPPET over POWHEG.

- file:ratio.ps shows the ratio of the HOPPET Hjj LO results to the
  POWHEG one (from its Hjj code). 

  Alexander discovered that POWHEG sets negative PDFs to zero and this
  causes a difference between HOPPET and POWHEG because HOPPET just
  accepts the negative values. The difference is only there because
  it's only NNPDF that has negative large-x PDFs. If POWHEG is
  modified to accept the negative PDFs (without zeroing), then one
  gets agreement

- file:ptj2.ps shows the <xmin> and <xmax> values as a function of
  ptj2.

  See also the plot of dbar/u: [[file:NNPDF30_Q500.ps]]

  So dbar goes negative around x=0.4. At In terms of
  magnitude, the WW channel has (u+dbar)*(d+ubar); the negative dbar
  reaches about 5% of the total at x=0.55 - 0.65. This is slightly
  higher than the <xmax>(pt=600) for which the POWHEG/HOPPET discrepancy
  reaches 5%. So numerically it's qualitatively consistent, though
  still a little bit puzzling in exact quantitative terms.

- file:NNPDF30_varying_Q.ps shows the NNPDF30 set at different Q values. 
  Each Q vaule has corresponding x value: x = 0.11 + 0.00015 * Q which gives 
  values in the range [0.11:0.9875].  

However, the question is anyway settled by the fact that switching off
the zeroing in POWHEG brings agreement.
