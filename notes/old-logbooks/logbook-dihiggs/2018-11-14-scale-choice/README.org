# Study of the scale choice

We try several different scales choices:

the default choice:
mu_0 = mh^2/4 + mh ptHH/2

the alternative using mHH
mu_dyn = mHH^2/4 + mHH ptHH/2

the max scale
mu_max = mHH^2/4 + ptHH^2

the alternative using 2mh in mu_0
mu_alt = mh^2 + mh ptHH

This is compared to sqrt(Q1,Q2), max(Q1,Q2), min(Q1,Q2), ptHH

We want something close to sqrt(Q1,Q2)

Plots are in file:test-scales.pdf

Conclusion: default mu_0 choice is reasonable approx of sqrt(Q1,Q2)
