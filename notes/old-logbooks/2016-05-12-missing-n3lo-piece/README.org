#+TITLE: Study of the effect of missing N3LO pieces
#+STARTUP: logdone entitiespretty latexpreview

The differences of the charged-current coefficient functions are known
only approximately.

To study the impact of this approximation, one can use the two
different approximations, and compare them with the default output
(which is the average of both)

default: IMOD = 0 ( ie. (IMOD=1 + IMOD=2)/2 )
total xsct:    3.9284357 pb
N3LO contrib: -0.0031744 pb

A: IMOD = 1:
total xsct:    3.9284361 pb
N3LO contrib: -0.0031740 pb

B: IMOD = 2:
total xsct:    3.9284354 pb
N3LO contrib: -0.0031747 pb

The uncertainty on the N3LO contribution can be estimated as follows:
(B-A)/default = 0.0000007/0.0031744 = 0.0002205

Hence the uncertainty on the N3LO part of the cross section is at the
0.3 permille level
