This folder contains a comparison of different Monte Carlo generators
when looking at NLO + parton shower.

We use the NLO Higgs + 2jet LHEF sample with 8e6 events.

The tunes used are
 - For Pythia 6 : Perugia 2011
 - For Pythia 8 : 4C (default)
 - For Herwig 6 : AUET2

Hadronisation is plotted as dashed lines.

The conclusion seems to be that the different MCs are relatively
compatible, within 2-4%. Miscellaneous remarks:
 - Pythia 8 is slightly below Pythia 6 and Herwig at low pt in ptH.
 - Pythia 6 is slightly above Pythia 8 and Herwig at high pt in ptj2.

Hadronisation effects are small, see related logbook entry in 
file:../2015-05-05-hadronisation-checks/README-hadronisation-checks.org
for more details.
