#+TITLE: test of scales v. ptH

In POWHEG it's difficult to get Q1 and Q2 (because they differ
according to the assignment of particles to the two sides).

So the only obvious option is to assign the scale based on ptH, which
is independent of the assignment of particles to the two sides.

Alexander has generated [[file:scales.ps]] which shows min(Q1,Q2) and
max(Q1,Q2) at LO as a function of ptH. 

[[file:scale-fits.gp]] is an attempt to fit the min and max scales by
eye (without the data points). 

<2015-04-21 Tue> it got adapted to try to get scales that are simpler
formulas, while still not being too far from the true <sqrt(Q1 Q2)>.


*Physical relevance of large ptH*: e.g. in invisible Higgs searches,
