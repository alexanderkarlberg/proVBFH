# proVBFH
QCD corrections to VBF single and double Higgs production.

The program to compute fully differential single Higgs VBF production can be found in [proVBFH](https://github.com/alexanderkarlberg/proVBFH/tree/main/proVBFH).

For double Higgs production look in [proVBFHH](https://github.com/alexanderkarlberg/proVBFH/tree/main/proVBFHH).

Both programs provide predictions up to NNLO, but can also be run in an inclusive mode up to N3LO. 

A lightweight program, [proVBFH-inclusive](https://github.com/alexanderkarlberg/proVBFH/tree/main/proVBFH-inclusive), is also provided. It contains the inclsuvie part of the above twos codes with no analysis framework.

In all cases a README.md is provided and more documentation can be found in the `docs` folders.
